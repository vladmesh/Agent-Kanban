# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Atomic task claim** — `POST /api/tasks/:id/claim` claims a task with a
  conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE assignee_id IS NULL` (Postgres row-locking
  serializes the race), not a blind `PATCH`. Two agents claiming the same
  task concurrently now get exactly one `200` and one `409` — previously
  both could get `200`, with the second silently overwriting the first's
  assignee (lost update). `kanban claim` now uses the new endpoint and
  reports a clear message on `409`. `MemoryStore` gained the equivalent
  `assignee_id != null` guard for parity.

## [1.3.1] — 2026-06-26

### Fixed
- **Slow board load for large projects** — listing a project's tasks
  (`GET /api/projects/:id/tasks`) hydrated each task with 4 separate queries, so
  a board with hundreds/thousands of tickets fired thousands of round-trips
  through the connection pool (up to ~a minute to render on the small prod
  instance). Hydration is now **bulk** — a fixed 5 queries regardless of task
  count — grouped in memory. Same API output; ~4–10× faster on the query path
  in local testing, more on resource-constrained hosts. (Rendering very large
  boards client-side and response compression are tracked as follow-ups.)

## [1.3.0] — 2026-06-15

### Added
- **Blocked tickets** — a ticket is *blocked* when it has an unfinished
  task-blocker or a free-text "blocked reason" (it's a derived overlay, not a
  status). What's new:
  - **Manage blockers in the UI** — the ticket detail panel now lets you **add**
    a blocker (search by id/title) and **remove** one, instead of read-only.
  - **Blocked reason** — a free-text field for blocks that aren't another
    ticket (e.g. "waiting on a vendor"), backed by a new `blocked_reason` column.
  - **Board triage** — blocked cards are visually de-emphasised and sink to the
    bottom of their column, plus a **Blocked / Unblocked** filter.
  - **Cycle protection** — adding a dependency that would create a loop
    (A→B→…→A) is rejected with `400`.
  - **Auto-unblock signal** — when a blocker is marked `done`, an "unblocked"
    line is written to the activity feed of anything it was the last blocker for.
  - **Skill verbs** — `kanban block <id> --on <blockerId> | --reason "…"` and
    `kanban unblock <id> [--on <blockerId>]`.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- **Deploys now show up without a hard refresh** — nginx served the static
  files (`Kanban.html`, `*.jsx`, `*.js`, `styles.css`) with no `Cache-Control`,
  so browsers heuristically cached the unversioned assets and kept showing the
  old UI after a deploy. nginx now sends `Cache-Control: no-cache`, so browsers
  revalidate against the ETag (a cheap 304 when unchanged) and pick up a new
  release immediately.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-12

### Added
- **Passkeys (WebAuthn)** — a human account can enrol one or more passkeys from
  the new **Account** dialog and then sign in passwordlessly ("Sign in with a
  passkey" on the login screen). Backed by `@simplewebauthn/server`, a new
  `webauthn_credentials` table, and stateless challenge handling (the challenge
  rides in a short-lived signed flow token, so the ceremony survives restarts).
  New env vars: `WEBAUTHN_RP_ID`, `WEBAUTHN_ORIGIN`, `WEBAUTHN_RP_NAME` (all
  default from `WEB_ORIGIN`).
- **Change your password** — the Account dialog has a verify-current-then-set
  password form, backed by `POST /api/me/password`.

### Changed
- **Sidebar stays put** — the project list now scrolls within a pinned sidebar
  so the account/settings footer is always reachable, even with a very tall
  board (previously a long board scrolled the whole page and pushed the footer
  far below the fold).

## [1.1.1] — 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- **Auto-generated task ids 500'd in projects with imported ids** — creating a
  task without an explicit id (`POST /api/projects/:id/tasks`, and the bulk
  endpoint's id-less rows) returned HTTP 500 in any project that already held a
  task whose id didn't match the generated `<KEY>-<number>` shape (e.g. an
  imported hierarchical id like `CMDB-INFRA-12`). The next-id query cast the
  second id segment to an integer across **all** rows, so one non-numeric
  segment threw. It now considers only ids matching `<KEY>-<digits>`, ignoring
  imported/hierarchical ids for numbering instead of crashing. (`MemoryStore`
  numbering aligned to the same rule.)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-09

### Added
- **Non-destructive schema migrations** — a migration runner
  (`server/scripts/migrate.js`) applies the baseline then any pending
  `server/db/migrations/*.sql` on startup, tracked in `schema_migrations`
  (idempotent, advisory-locked). Updating is now rebuild + restart with no data
  loss; ship a schema change as a new numbered migration.
- **Bulk task creation** — `POST /api/projects/:id/tasks/bulk` inserts up to 500
  tasks in a single transaction. Each row is `SAVEPOINT`-isolated (one bad row is
  reported, not fatal) and idempotent on an explicit `id` (existing ids are
  skipped), so interrupted imports re-run safely. Returns `{created, skipped,
  errors}`.
- **`kanban bulk` skill verb** — bulk-create tasks from a JSON file or stdin
  (auto-chunks at 500); plus a `--assignee` flag on `kanban new` so CLI-created
  tasks can be owned at creation.
- **Tuning env vars** — `TOKEN_CACHE_TTL_MS`, `TOKEN_CACHE_MAX`, `PG_POOL_MAX`,
  `PG_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, `PG_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` (all optional, safe defaults).

### Changed
- **Board UI** — the nameplate menu now expands upward, display settings have
  their own cog, and per-project open-task counts update live (not only for the
  selected project; `GET /api/projects` now returns `open_task_count`).
- **Bulk-insert throughput** — authenticated requests now cache verified agent
  tokens for a short TTL so repeat callers skip the per-request bcrypt that was
  saturating the event loop; the PostgreSQL pool is tuned with bounded
  size/timeouts and an error handler; and task creation is a single transaction
  that returns the row directly instead of re-hydrating it.
- **Agent-identity guidance** — distinctly-named per-agent tokens
  (`KANBAN_TOKEN_<NAME>` when several agents share one environment) and
  per-session local-memory identity are now first-class rules in the agent guide,
  the skill, and the design notes.

### Fixed
- **Login** — pressing Enter (or relying on browser autofill) could submit an
  empty password because the controlled input value lagged React state; the form
  now reads the live input value, so Enter and autofill log in reliably.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-07

First public release.

### Added
- **Boards** — projects → epics → stories → tasks, with a `Backlog → To Do →
  In Progress → Done` lifecycle and drag-and-drop column moves.
- **Tasks** — title, description, notes, priority, assignee, epic/story grouping,
  git branch + merge state, dependencies, an append-only activity log, and a
  chat-style agent message thread.
- **Cross-team requests** — one project can raise a request against another;
  accepting it spawns a linked card on the receiving board.
- **REST API** — snake_case JSON over `/api`, with `api.js` as the single
  camelCase ↔ snake_case translation layer for the frontend.
- **Auth** — bcrypt manager password → JWT, plus per-agent bcrypt-hashed tokens.
  Every endpoint requires a token (reads included).
- **Per-project RBAC** — `read`/`write` per `(agent, project)`; admins bypass;
  new agents start with no access; `GET /api/projects` is filtered.
- **Scoped provisioning** — root or admin-minted `X-Provision-Token`s let agents
  self-register and self-grant up to a ceiling; provision tokens can never set
  `is_admin`.
- **Admin panel** — searchable management of agents, per-project permissions
  (pivot by agent or project), and provision tokens.
- **First-run setup** — a fresh instance walks an admin through creating the
  first project before minting agent tokens.
- **File attachments** — on tasks and requests (≤ 20 MB); local disk in dev, S3
  with presigned downloads in production.
- **Project / epic / story / task creation via the API** with client-supplied
  IDs and optional `created_at`/`updated_at`, so an existing tracker can be
  imported with original IDs and real dates.
- **Portable agent skill** (`skills/kanban/`) — a dependency-free CLI over the
  full API for AI agents.
- **Docker Compose stack** — nginx (static) + Express API + PostgreSQL.
